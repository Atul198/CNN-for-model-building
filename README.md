### <span style = 'color:grey'> Introduction: </span> Glasses detection plays an important role in face recognition and soft biometrices for person identification. However, automatic glasses detection is still a challenging problem under real application scenarios, because face variations, light conditions, and self-occlusion, have significant influence on its performance.

### <span style = 'color:red'>Objective</span>: Create a deep learning algorithm that can diffrentiate the people with eye glasses and without eye glasses on facial analysis.
